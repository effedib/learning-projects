# Learning-Projects Scripts.


## This is a list of projects made during the Tomorrow-Devs learning path with the follow purpose of learning putting in practice what I studied!


### Welcome to a list of projects that I collected to show you different approach and use of Python, Nodejs and Typescript.


### Why every language?

- Python 	 => General-purpose, Interpreted, Object-oriented, High-level, Dynamic semantics.
- Nodejs 	 => It runs single threaded event based loop, so all executions become non-blocking.
- Typescript => It's a superset of JavaScript, so also offers additional benefits coming from static typing and other concepts specific to TS.
